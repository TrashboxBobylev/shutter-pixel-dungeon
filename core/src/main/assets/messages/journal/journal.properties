journal.document.adventurers_guide.title=Tome of Dungeon Mastery
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title=Introduction
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body=Greetings Adventurer, you are reading the Tome of Dungeon Mastery. This book is full of tips and tricks to help budding adventurers survive and excel!\n\nThis guide is best used as a reference, and will magically let you know when is the best time to read each page.\n\n(Whenever the journal icon at the top-right blinks, the guidebook has something to tell you! Some pages seem to be ripped out of the book though, perhaps you can find them in the dungeon?)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.title=Examining
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.body=Rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them. It's important to study your opponents and surroundings to learn how to defeat them!\n\nExamining things also takes no time, so get in the habit of doing it to everything new you encounter.\n\n(You can examine something by using the magnifying glass button, and selecting the thing you want to examine. You can also examine buffs or debuffs by selecting their icons.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title=Surprise Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body=You're guaranteed to hit an enemy if you surprise them by attacking from outside of their view, or right as you enter their view.\n\nEven the most evasive enemies can't dodge a surprise attack, which makes them very useful against enemies like wraiths and snakes.\n\nOne of the most common parts of the environment you can use to surprise enemies is a door. If an enemy chases you through a door you can attack them right after they enter it and catch them by surprise!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title=Identifying Items
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body=You won't know all of the properties of some items when you first find them.\n\nThe colors of potions and symbols on scrolls are different in each dungeon. Unidentified equipment can be upgraded or enchanted if you're lucky, or it might be cursed!\n\nScrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of using unidentified equipment.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title=Dealing with Hunger
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body=Rationing food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival. Try thinking of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, not kept full at all times.\n\nWhen you aren't starving you will slowly regenerate health. So if you eat at full health, this regeneration will be wasted.\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on how your health is doing, your food should last much longer.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title=Handling Defeat
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body=Unfortunately, dungeoneering is a very dangerous profession and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise.\n\nWhile luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds of success.\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dying a lot, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.title=Searching
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.body=Dungeons are full of secret doorways and traps which appear invisible at first glance. Searching takes time, but is very useful if you suspect something is hidden.\n\nSearch near walls if you suspect a door is hidden, or around floors if you suspect a trap is hidden.\n\n(You can search all the tiles around you by using the magnifying glass button twice. Anything that's hidden in these tiles will be revealed. Maybe there are some hidden doors near where you found this page!)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title=Strength
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body=There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are the most effective way to meet the strength requirements of higher tier gear.\n\nIt's important to work towards using high tier items, but don't completely ignore equipment you can use sooner. Once you're deep enough in the dungeon you'll need high tier gear to survive, but you have to survive long enough to equip them first!
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.title=Upgrades
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.body=The deeper you go into a dungeon, the more important it is that you're using magically enhanced high tier gear.\n\nHigher tier weapons and armor gain more power from upgrades, but you'll also need the strength to use them properly. Wands, rings, and artifacts don't need strength, but have limited usages or don't help as directly in combat.\n\nMaking good choices about what you upgrade is very important for surviving early in the dungeon, and for setting yourself up for success later in the dungeon.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title=Effective Looting
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body=Specific rooms will often contain better loot. Some of these rooms will be behind locked doors, or will contain obstacles which must be overcome.\n\nWhenever an obstacle blocks your progress, look for a solution nearby. You can usually find an item to help you on the same floor.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are an excellent benchmark of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 2 potions of strength and 3 scrolls of upgrade in each five floor dungeon region.\n\n(You can see a list of important landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title=Gaining Experience
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body=Your experience level boosts your accuracy, evasion, health, and awards talent points. All of these can make a big difference in combat. It's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but doing so will deprive you of both supplies and experience.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the corner of the game interface. Select your hero portrait to get even more info.)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.title=Positioning
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.body=Effectively fighting enemies depends on good strategy as well as strong equipment. Bad situations like getting surrounded can usually be avoided with good positioning.\n\nFor instance, most dungeons have thin corridors, which are excellent at forcing enemies to fight you one at a time. These corridors often have doorways too, which can be used for surprise attacks!\n\nThere are lots of little ways to use environmental features like grass, water, or traps to your advantage as well.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title=Magical Attacks
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body=Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge. This means that your wands will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous!\n\nMagical attacks always have a drawback though. Wands have limited charges and magical enemies usually won't be able to use their magic in close range.\n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is important to learn how to prevent them from using it on you.

journal.document.alchemy_guide.title=Alchemy Guide
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.title=Intro and Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.body=Welcome to Practical Applications of Alchemy!\n\nAlchemy recipes can be used to craft a wide variety of items at an alchemy pot. You can experiment to find recipes, or continue reading this book for a full recipe reference!\n\nWe will start with the most iconic alchemy recipe: Place any three seeds into an alchemy pot to brew a random potion!\n\nEvery seed has a potion counterpart, and the potion you create may relate to one of the seeds used. Using multiple of the same seed will increase the chance for this to occur.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.title=Creating Runestones
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.body=Mixing a scroll into an alchemy pot will imbue its magic into two rocks within the pot. This creates runestones!
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.title=Energy and Food
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.body=Many recipes require crystalized alchemical energy, which is produced by deconstructing most consumable items in an alchemy pot. As a few examples: seeds generate 2 energy, stones generate 3, scrolls and potions each generate 6.\n\nSome of these recipes are quite magical, but these ones more resemble traditional cooking.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.title=Exotic Potions
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.body=Potions can be mixed with energy to create exotic potions. They have more powerful effects, but are often useful in different ways.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.title=Exotic Scrolls
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.body=Exotic scrolls can be made with some energy and a scroll. They're a bit stronger and more expensive than exotic potions.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.title=Enhanced Bombs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.body=A standard black powder bomb can be mixed with a specific item to create an enhanced bomb.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.title=Enhancing Weapons
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.body=Some of the lighter or more magical weapons can be used in alchemy!\n\nEach thrown weapon produces enough liquid metal to fully repair another weapon of the same level and tier.\n\nOne wand will produce enough arcane resin to upgrade two wands of the same level, but no higher than +3.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.title=Catalysts
journal.document.alchemy_guide.catalysts.body=Catalysts are made by combining a scroll or potion with a single seed or runestone. If the pair of items match, the alchemical energy cost is removed.\n\nCatalysts are most useful as components in recipes covered in the next two pages, but also can be used in a pinch for a random effect.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.title=Brews and Elixirs
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.body=Brews and elixirs are advanced potions which provide a variety of effects with a single use.
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.title=Spells
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.body=Spells are contained in crystals and provide a variety of effects with multiple uses.

journal.document.intros.title=Region Introductions
journal.document.intros.dungeon.title=Dungeon
journal.document.intros.dungeon.body=Many heroes have ventured into the dungeon before you from the city above, most have never been heard from again.\n\nIt is said that an ancient evil lurks in the depths, guarding the almighty Amulet of Yendor. Even now dark energy radiates from below, making its way up into the city.\n\nWill you conquer the dungeon and claim the amulet? It's time to start your own adventure!
journal.document.intros.sewers.title=Sewers
journal.document.intros.sewers.body=The upper floors of the dungeon actually constitute the city's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more ferocious. The city has had to send guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.
journal.document.intros.prison.title=Prison
journal.document.intros.prison.body=Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...
journal.document.intros.caves.title=Caves
journal.document.intros.caves.body=These sparsely populated caves stretch down under the abandoned prison. Rich in minerals, they were once a center of bustling trade and industry for the dwarven society below, but they were abandoned as the dwarves became obsessed with dark magic.\n\nThe caves are now mostly inhabited by subterranean wildlife, gnolls, and derelict machinery; likely corrupted by the same power that has affected the regions above.
journal.document.intros.city.title=Dwarven Metropolis
journal.document.intros.city.body=The Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of all dwarven city-states. In its heyday the dwarves built wondrous machines of metal and magic that allowed their city to expand rapidly.\n\nThen, one day, the city gates were barred and nobody heard from the dwarves again. The few who escaped the city as it closed told stories of a mad warlock who stole the throne, and the terrible magic he had learned to harness.
journal.document.intros.halls.title=Demon Halls
journal.document.intros.halls.body=These deep halls of the Dwarven Metropolis have been twisted by dark magic. In the past these regions played host to the Dwarf King's court of elite warlocks, but now they seem to have been taken over by something even more sinister...\n\nAll sorts of horrific demonic creatures inhabit these halls, being led by some terrible dark power. If the King of Dwarves wasn't the source of the spreading corruption, whatever is down here must be.\n\nTread carefully, very few adventurers have ever descended this far...

journal.document.sewers_guard.title=Guard's Letters
journal.document.sewers_guard.new_position.title=My New Position!
journal.document.sewers_guard.new_position.body=85th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nI told you all the hard work at the city guard would pay off. I just got promoted!\n\nI've been invited to join a specialist team that works in the sewers. Apparently there are problems with vermin and outlaws down there, and it's our job to clear them out. It's messy work, but the sewers are warm in the winter and it pays three times as much as regular guard duty!\n\nIt's all a bit secretive though, so I can't actually send this letter. It feels weird to not write to you, so I'm going to keep writing them anyway. Maybe I can show them to you one day.\n\nBest,\n- Sonya
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.title=A Dangerous Position...
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.body=88th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nI understand why the pay is so good now, the sewers are infested with monsters! The 'vermin' and 'outlaws' are giant bloodthirsty rats and packs of angry gnolls.\n\nThankfully the rest of my team really knows what they're doing. Our team captain, Thomas, is an expert at this. I'm trying to learn quickly so that I'm not too much of a burden.\n\nThis job is a lot more dangerous than I thought. I'm glad I can't send these now, I don't want you to worry.\n\nI'll keep safe,\n- Sonya
journal.document.sewers_guard.crabs.title=Giant Crabs!
journal.document.sewers_guard.crabs.body=11th of Winter, 376\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nAs if the rats weren't bad enough, deeper down there are giant crabs! One of them charged right past me and got Lee pretty badly before we killed it. Thomas says it's not my fault, but I know he's just trying to be nice to me.\n\nThankfully, on our way out we ran into an adventurer who had some spare sungrass salve. Lee might not have made it without that stuff.\n\nI saw the adventurer staring at a rose before they left, they said it was a gift. Why would they risk their life down here if someone cares about them so much?\n\nThat's exactly what I'm doing isn't it? I feel like I'm in over my head.
journal.document.sewers_guard.guild.title=The Thieves' Guild
journal.document.sewers_guard.guild.body=23rd of Winter, 376\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nNo new monsters this time, instead we ran into a small group from the thieves' guild while on patrol.\n\nEverything I've heard about the guild is bad, but the rest of my team seemed almost friendly with them. Thomas exchanged information and supplies with one of them before we went our separate ways.\n\nI don't understand, weren't we supposed to be getting rid of outlaws? Thomas even said not to mention this to anyone in command. Their information and supplies were very useful though, and we couldn't handle even more fighting.\n\nI suppose we're all in this together down here.
journal.document.sewers_guard.lost.title=We're Lost
journal.document.sewers_guard.lost.body=40th of Winter, 376\n\nThomas and I are lost. We got driven away from the rest of the team while fighting some gnolls. Neither of us are hurt, but the lower sewers are like a maze.\n\nThomas says he knows a route out, but it starts at the old prison entrance at the bottom of the sewers. I really don't like going deeper, but we don't have any rations and going down is much faster than wandering around looking for our patrol route.\n\nIt'll be alright. Thomas knows what he's doing.
journal.document.sewers_guard.not_worth.title=It's Not Worth It
journal.document.sewers_guard.not_worth.body=Thomas and I ran into some sort of massive ooze monster at the prison entrance. Before we could react it blasted us with magic. Thomas took most of it. He's gone.\n\nNo amount of money is worth this. I'm going to leave through the route Thomas told me about. Then I'll take what I've earned as a guard and use it to move my parents and I away from this cursed city. Part of me wants to hope that the King has a plan for all this, but I doubt it.\n\nI'm leaving these letters behind as a warning to others. It's more than just giant rats and crabs, something is very wrong down here.
journal.document.prison_warden.title=Warden's Journal
journal.document.prison_warden.journal.title=Keeping a Journal
journal.document.prison_warden.journal.body=1st of Spring, 362\n\nThis is the first entry in the work journal of prison warden Kiana Smith. With all that's been going on lately, I've decided to start a journal to keep my thoughts in order.\n\nManaging a prison half a mile underground was never going to be easy, but lately it seems like some sort of organized disruption is happening. Inmates have been acting out for no reason and then refusing to explain why.\n\nSome of the guards are starting to say the place is haunted. I can't let my own people spread rumours, but I can't exactly blame them for being uneasy.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.recruits.title=New Recruits
journal.document.prison_warden.recruits.body=80th of Spring, 362\n\nAs promised, a bunch of new recruits arrived today. It seems like the usual, a few promising ones and lots of grunts who just want the pay. Still, having all this new muscle should help a lot with our recent unruly inmates.\n\nIn a job like this it's important to know who you can trust. One new hire, Thomas, seems especially promising. I need all the help I can get right now, so if he does well I'll see about getting him promoted quickly.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.mines.title=Sealing the Mines
journal.document.prison_warden.mines.body=54th of Winter, 363\n\nA group of engineers from the city came today, saying that they're here to seal off the old entrance to the mines below. I suppose the city doesn't want to bother maintaining the passage anymore. I wasn't informed beforehand, as usual.\n\nTheir head engineer also told me some nonsense about dwarven magic leaking in from the mines. I don't believe a word of it.\n\nThe situation is under much better control with our new staff, but the root of the problem still hasn't been addressed. Something is definitely affecting the inmates here, and knocking down a few walls isn't going to change that.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.rotberry.title=Rotberry Plant
journal.document.prison_warden.rotberry.body=23rd of Autumn, 363\n\nReceived a lovely present from Felix today. It's some sort of bright red shrub called a 'Rotberry'.\n\nI've mentioned how dreary this place is to him before, seems he was listening. According to him this plant actually dislikes light and water, so I just have to trim the leaves back once a month or so. Trimming it must be important though, he mentioned it a dozen times in his letter.\n\nOf course, Felix never does anything for free. He says that the seeds this thing produces are great for making wands, so naturally I owe him a few each time the plant produces some.\n- Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.no_support.title=No Support
journal.document.prison_warden.no_support.body=11th of Spring, 364\n\nWhat the hell is the city thinking? After urgently requesting help I've heard nothing, not even an empty apology like they usually send when my requests are denied.\n\nMeanwhile the inmates continue to get worse, and some of the guards have even started to cause trouble. Do they plan to just let this keep getting worse until we're dealing with a riot!?\n\nThomas has stayed reliable as ever at least. His organizational help has been invaluable, and his idea to activate those old DM-100 units was regrettable but necessary. I'm confident I can get back on top of this situation, I just need some damned support!\n-Smith
journal.document.prison_warden.letter.title=Letter to Thomas
journal.document.prison_warden.letter.body=Thomas,\n\nYou've been a great friend, so I'm doing you a favour.\n\nWhen you start your shift tonight, lock and reinforce Tengu's cell, throw the key into some alcove, and get out. It doesn't matter if the other prisoners are unattended, pretty soon nobody will be able to leave this place. That freak has to stay secured though, if he escapes there's no telling what he'll do.\n\nTell nobody of this, and don't bother looking for me. A captain must go down with her ship.\n- Kiana
journal.document.caves_explorer.title=Explorer's Log
journal.document.caves_explorer.expedition.title=Expedition Start!
journal.document.caves_explorer.expedition.body=1st of Summer, 308\n\nToday begins our four week expedition into the abandoned dwarven mines! I have been commissioned by the king himself to explore the region. My chief goals are to find any untapped natural resources and to survey the caves for a potential prison construction project.\n\nWhile I am capable of defending myself, I have accepted an escort from the city guard at the king's insistence. They're a bunch of simpletons, but as long as they don't slow me down their presence is tolerable.\n\nWe are expected to clear the sewers and reach the mines by evening.\n- Archibald Drummond. Archmage, southern wizarding institute.
journal.document.caves_explorer.gold.title=So Much Gold!
journal.document.caves_explorer.gold.body=4th of Summer, 308\n\nOur first few days have been very fruitful indeed! After establishing a base camp, we set out exploring some of the upper areas of the abandoned mine. While there is plenty of useless clutter left by the dwarves, many of the cave walls are also teeming with gold!\n\nUnfortunately, we aren't the first ones here. The caves are rife with aggressive wildlife, and it seems packs of gnolls have an interest in the gold as well. I admit that I was unfair toward my guard escort, they have been much more capable explorers and bodyguards than I expected.\n\nEven with this success, we still have much of the mines left to explore.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.troll.title=Met a Troll
journal.document.caves_explorer.troll.body=11th of Summer, 308\n\nAfter beginning our exploration into the midsection of the mines, we ran into a friendly face! Well... relatively friendly. A cave troll has set up a little smithy there. He is gruff and not very talkative, but did repair our equipment in exchange for some gold.\n\nUnfortunately, the troll blacksmith has also informed us that all of this lovely gold isn't quite as good as it seems. He calls it 'dark gold' and it apparently rapidly degrades in sunlight. That would certainly explain why there were never any conflicts over the resources here.\n\nI suppose we need to delve a little deeper to see if there is anything more valuable.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.city.title=The City Entrance
journal.document.caves_explorer.city.body=21st of Summer, 308\n\nWe're now at the three week mark, and after spending much of the last ten days charting ever deeper, we have finally reached the bottom of the mines. We found various metal contraptions and a great gate which blocks entry to the old dwarven metropolis.\n\nThe blacksmith warned us about some of this machinery. It was apparently meant for area defense and has a tendency to activate when disturbed. We have no business in the city, and the metal would have minimal scrap value, so we thought it best to heed his warning and head back out.\n\nI must admit I was curious, but investigating down there certainly wasn't worth the risk.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.alive.title=It's Alive!
journal.document.caves_explorer.alive.body=23rd of Summer, 308\n\nOne of the dwarven machines came to life somehow! We were merely passing by when it charged and almost crushed two of our group with its huge metal fists. Luckily, I was carrying my wand of disintegration with me. A few well-aimed blasts from that and the beastly thing was reduced to scrap metal.\n\nWhat troubles me is that we did absolutely nothing to provoke the machine. The dwarves couldn't possibly have designed the machines to be so aggressive, it's as if it was trying to ambush us!\n\nAt least I was able to offer some help to my companions for once.\n- Archibald
journal.document.caves_explorer.report.title=Final Report
journal.document.caves_explorer.report.body=28th of Summer, 308\n\nToday we will finish packing up our belongings and prepare to leave. Just in time as well, several of our group have begun having terrible nightmares following the incident with the aggressive machine. It's probably just fatigue, but their nightmares are all worryingly similar.\n\nIn summary, the upper areas of the mine are quite safe. If a use could be found for dark gold then mining it may be quite lucrative. The large open spaces would work very well for the city's construction plans as well. The lower mines are more dangerous however, and should be avoided.\n\nI'll write all this into my final report over the next few days.\n- Archibald
journal.document.city_warlock.title=Warlock's Journal
journal.document.city_warlock.old_king.title=The King is Dead
journal.document.city_warlock.old_king.body=It is the 5th day of the 2nd month of the 33rd year of the age of magic. If an overworlder is reading this, it is sometime in Winter 264. My name is Thymor Zahir, and to the best of my knowledge I am the last surviving member of the dwarven court.\n\nOur King is dead, replaced by one of my former colleagues who has gone mad with power. The rest of the court submitted to him, like the fools they are, and lost their free will in the process. I alone saw this coming and fled before his ritual could be completed.\n\nThe inner circle has fallen, but the New King's power has not yet reached everyone. I must mount a resistance as quickly as possible. I refuse to let our glorious civilization fall to this megalomaniac!
journal.document.city_warlock.resistance.title=A Resistance
journal.document.city_warlock.resistance.body=Word seems to have spread quickly. It has only been a few days and I have already amassed a small army of loyalists to the Old King. Few are skilled with magic, but almost the entire order of warrior monks is among us. We should be more than a match for one crazed dwarf and his court of slaves.\n\nMeanwhile the New King has hidden himself in the inner chambers of our city. No doubt he has expended most of his power and is hoping to recover before he encounters more resistance.\n\nWe will launch our attack in another couple of hours. With luck we will be able to form an interim council and return our wondrous city to stability by the end of the night.
journal.document.city_warlock.failure.title=Failure
journal.document.city_warlock.failure.body=It seems that I'm a fool as well. I assumed that the New King needed the court to submit to him willingly, but now I see that he has the power to control even those who resist him.\n\nI blindly brought all of the strongest opposition right to his doorstep so that he could personally turn them into his slaves. Now waves of his necrotic energy are washing through the city, instantly turning most into his supplicants.\n\nThe few who still have free will are fleeing. I have chosen to stay behind to observe as best I can and look for an opening. With the magic power I have I should be able to stay hidden and safe for some time.
journal.document.city_warlock.more_powerful.title=More Powerful
journal.document.city_warlock.more_powerful.body=Keeping track of time has become difficult, but it has been about a week since my last entry. Our civilization has truly collapsed. The gates are shut, all functions of our society have ceased, and empty dwarven husks roam the halls.\n\nThroughout all of this, somehow, the New King is becoming even more powerful. Every day the force of his will becomes stronger, but it is also changing. I cannot describe it, but it feels as if he is no longer a dwarf at all.\n\nI'm beginning to accept that the best I can probably hope to do is document these events. I will stay here for as long as I can, and then retreat once my will begins to weaken.
journal.document.city_warlock.new_power.title=A New Power
journal.document.city_warlock.new_power.body=What is happening here? The power emanating from the New King is indeed different than at first, but there is something else too. This new power seems to radiate from the innermost halls of our city.\n\nEven more puzzling is that activity in the upper metropolis has decreased as well. I do not know what is happening down there, but it is attracting almost all of the New King's attention.\n\nReturning to the deep halls will be dangerous, but I must discover what is causing this change. Perhaps the New King has a weakness after all?
journal.document.city_warlock.seen_it.title=I've Seen It
journal.document.city_warlock.seen_it.body=I have seen what lies below, but I cannot describe it. My hands shake uncontrollably as I try to put my thoughts into writing.\n\nWhy is this happening? Did the New King do this? It makes no sense. Perhaps his wanton use of power attracted it? I had hoped to save our civilization, but now I see that the entire world is at stake.\n\nSomehow, the king is the lesser evil. I have no other choice, for the greater good I will surrender myself. Please guide me my king, use me as an instrument to hold Yog-Dzewa at bay!
journal.document.halls_king.title=???'s Journal
journal.document.halls_king.rejection.title=Rejection
journal.document.halls_king.rejection.body=IMBECILES!\n\nOver the last 33 years our kingdom has flourished with our new magical technology. We've learned how to summon elemental spirits and bend them to our will, but somehow now further experimentation is 'too dangerous'.\n\nI know what's really going on. The rejection of my theories has nothing to do with their merit and everything to do with the person who suggests them. They're probably all laughing at me behind my back.\n\nWell no more! I don't care what they say, I will explore the furthest reaches of our universe alone, and keep everything I discover for myself!\n- R.

journal.document.halls_king.amulet.body=I'VE DONE IT!\n\nI didn't know what I might find exactly, but what I discovered out there was beyond my wildest speculation. So much power, just sitting there ready to be taken, and it's all mine!\n\nWith this none of the fools in the court will dare oppose me. I'm just giddy thinking about all the different ways I could humiliate them. Hell, why stop there, I have enough power to destroy every last one of them if I want! That might be excessive, but I mustn't take too long deciding or they'll get suspicious.\n\nI think I'll call this great power the Amulet of Yendor!\n- R.
journal.document.halls_king.ritual.title=The Ritual
journal.document.halls_king.ritual.body=Thymor publicly confronted me earlier today and insisted I explain my new source of power. I dismissed him as best I could, but I can feel the judging eyes of the rest of the court on me once again.\n\nI had hoped to spend a little more time enjoying the calm before the storm, but it doesn't really matter. I've decided what I want to do. I will claim I gained my power through a new ritual, and will offer to perform it on the other warlocks and the King. Once the ritual is over, I will be king!\n\nThymor will protest, of course, but with this much power on offer I doubt they will listen to him!\n\nALL WILL BOW BEFORE ME!\n- Future King of the Dwarves
journal.document.halls_king.new_king.title=A New King
journal.document.halls_king.new_king.body=I AM KING, AHAHAHAHAAA!\n\nThey just let me do it! With hardly any convincing they agreed to let me 'share' this power with them in a great ritual. In an instant they were transformed from a chorus of mocking voices to my new court of silent subjects!\n\nPredictably, Thymor fled like a coward at the first sign of trouble. I can already feel the resistance force he is building as well. I think I'll allow him to continue, so that he can deliver all of his conspirators right to my door!\n\nClearly the kingdom doesn't respect me either, I suppose I'll fix that as well.\n- King of the Dwarves
journal.document.halls_king.thing.title=The Thing
journal.document.halls_king.thing.body=There's a problem. Thymor was dispatched without effort, but it seems my scrounging in the outer planes did not go unnoticed.\n\nSome... 'thing'... has been attracted to my world and is starting to force itself through at the bottom of the lower halls. To complicate things further, that is the exact location where I stored the amulet! Such a spiteful creature, why must it try to deny me my power when there is plenty out there still to take?\n\nDespite my power though, I don't think I can just charge in and fight it. Its true power is unfathomable, but there must be some way to limit it. I WILL DEFEND MY PRIZE!
journal.document.halls_king.attrition.title=Attrition
journal.document.halls_king.attrition.body=I have a plan for dealing with the thing. Its power is infinite, but its ability to encroach on this world is not. It's relying on minions and avatars to do its bidding while it tries to build enough power to take the amulet.\n\nWhile I don't possess the amulet physically I still have full control over its power. With the entire dwarven city at my disposal I also have a numbers advantage. I can simply keep sending soldiers to prevent it from seizing the amulet and steadily win this war through attrition!\n\nI DON'T CARE HOW LONG IT TAKES, I WILL OUTLAST YOU YOG-DZEWA!

journal.document.better_lore.title=Definitely very good lore and not auto-generated at all
journal.document.better_lore.page1.title=A blog pretty much about nothing...
journal.document.better_lore.page1.body=Very few adventurers ever descended this far... or so the legends say. Perhaps because the rumors about the hellish creatures dwelling in the depths, perhaps because the darkness itself keeps people away from the depths.\n\nSome say that these levels exist only as a metaphor for the pains of life. That many of the monsters in the dungeons below exist only as representations of unpleasant feelings, fears, frustrations, etc.\n\nNo one dares go down to these levels, because no one has ever come back. These mysterious levels are only accessible via teleportation spells. There are various rumors about these levels - such as that they are the realm of dragons, or that they are the deepest levels of the Dungeon, or that the surface world is just a dream within these caverns, or that these levels are the home of the ancient gods who created the Dungeon.\n\nThe Dungeon's upper levels are inhabited by goblins, kobolds, rats, and other small creatures.
journal.document.better_lore.page2.title=Horizontal Moving Network
journal.document.better_lore.page2.body=Not much is known about the City, as it is spoken of a few times in the game. The City consists mostly of sewers, though at least one level appears to be above ground. According to the story, the City has been used as a base for various nefarious activities over the ages.\n\nThe City's lower levels are occupied by monsters, including more goblins, kobolds, and rats. In addition, there are also several levels where the City's inhabitants live, such as the Grand Hall, the Governor's Mansion, the King's Court, the Wizard's Tower, and the Great Library. There is no evidence that any of these buildings are actually real.\n\nThere are four levels of the City: The Sewer System, The Underworld, The Underground City, and The Overworld.
journal.document.better_lore.page3.title=Cross-hairs
journal.document.better_lore.page3.body=Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike game. It can be played in single player mode, or in multiplayer cooperative gameplay. In order to play the game, you must first create a character. You may choose either a male or female Hero. Your starting location is determined by your gender, and you are given the option to select one of three races, each of which has different abilities and strengths and weaknesses. Each hero starts out with a basic weapon (sword, shield, spear), as well as a set amount of gold coins and experience points. Experience is obtained through combat, exploration, and finding treasure. When you gain enough experience, your character gains a new skill. Skills are divided into six categories (Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma).\n\nThe game uses ASCII characters for its graphics, and the background is a simple maze-like tunnel. While exploring the dungeon, players can find items, weapons, armor, food, potions and much more. The game features many standard elements of the genre, such as health and mana bars, item attributes.

?Aelion, The Evil Lord\n\n \
***\n\n \
This is my castle, the source of all evil. Here I rule and reign alone.\n \
My fortress was built by my ancestors. My bloodline is the strongest.\n \
If you try to enter without permission, you shall die!\n\
The amulet is mine!\n\
- Aelion, the Evil Lord\n\n\
Aelion is a powerful wizard who rules over the Dungeon. He was imprisoned for crimes against humanity when he was young; however, he has become an unstoppable force of evil. His hatred for humanity has grown stronger with the passage of time and he has taken to torturing and murdering anyone who dares approach.

journal.document.better_lore.page5.body=But Amulet is not resting without a fight. It is guarded by the Guardian, a giant statue that has the ability to control the dungeon and make it even harder for intruders. The guardian can turn the dungeon into a living hell, trapping heroes in a labyrinth full of traps and monsters. If the guardian is defeated, the dungeon becomes easy to conquer.\n\n \
The Amulet of Yendor was lost long ago, and it is said that its power will give the bearer ultimate power. It was stolen by Aelion, who has since built an entire city beneath the Dungeon to keep the relic hidden.\n\n\
I am the master of this land!\n\
You dare to enter the lair of the Evil Lord?!\n\
- Aelion, the Evil Lord\n\n\
The Guardian is a huge statue that stands at the entrance of the Dungeon. It was built by Aelion to protect the amulet. It is said that the statue can change the landscape of the dungeon, making it a dangerous place for intruders.
journal.document.better_lore.page6.title=Hannibal's Tranquil
journal.document.better_lore.page6.body=The Aelion presumably comes from the City and entered the Dungeon in order to start their great adventure, clear the Dungeon, and get the Amulet of Yendor.\n\
You think you're worthy of the Amulet of Yendor?\n\
- Aelion\n\n\
The Dark Lord is a mysterious creature that dwells in the depths of the Dungeon. No one knows anything about him except that he wants the Amulet and will stop at nothing to obtain it. No one ever saw the Dark Lord, but his minions are very dangerous.\n\n\
Aelion's army consists mainly of orcs, ogres, and other evil creatures. They are very strong and they have a high morale, which makes them very dangerous. They will attack heroes with overwhelming forces and are very difficult to defeat.\n\n\
- We have no intention of letting you go. Surrender now and we might spare you.\n\
-- Aelion's troops\n\
The orcs are very dangerous.
journal.document.better_lore.page7.title=The Dating Panic: The New Fear of Intimacy
journal.document.better_lore.page7.body=Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a Roguelike RPG, with pixel art graphics and lots of variety and replayability. Every game is unique, with four different playable characters, randomized levels and enemies, and over 150 items to collect and use. The game is simple to get into, but has lots of depth. Strategy is required if you want to win!\n\n\
You must be strong if you seek the treasure deep below...\n\
If you fail, your life will never be the same again...\n\
The evil Lord watches your every step!\n\
The Evil Lord rules from his castle in the middle of the dungeon. He constantly patrols his territory, seeking those who have violated his domain. The only way to leave is by finding the exit portal. If you succeed, you will return to the surface and will gain experience. However, should you die, you will not get the experience, and your character will be dead for good. This game is based on the roguelike video game tradition of death and re-spawning. You can try out different characters as you progress through the dungeons, collecting items, weapons and equipment along the way.
journal.document.better_lore.page8.title=What Yoinks Tryptophan!
journal.document.better_lore.page8.body=The Dark Lord was defeated but he has been reborn! This time his forces are even more powerful. Your mission is to enter his castle and retrieve the Amulet of Yendor before the evil Lord can reclaim it!\n\n\
Aelion's forces are more than just a simple army. They are highly skilled and they know every part of the Dungeon's complex network of passages and chambers. Their job is to protect the evil lord and the Amulet of Yendor.\n\n\
There is another group of monsters, however, which does not obey the evil lord's commands. The orcs will do whatever they can to stop intruders from reaching their leader. Their leader is the Dark Lord himself. They are also called "rogues" or "dark warriors", and they are very dangerous enemies to face on the way.
journal.document.better_lore.page9.title=Numberjack
journal.document.better_lore.page9.body=Runic Blade is a really bad weapon, coming from a veteran of the game. Its stats are terrible and its ability is extremely weak, but it is extremely rare and so the players always want it.\n\n\
  Aelion, the evil lord, built an underground city beneath the Dungeon. There he keeps the Amulet of Yendor hidden. This ancient relic is supposed to grant ultimate power and is sought after by both good and evil adventurers.\n\
We were created in his image. Our sole purpose is to guard this treasure.\n\n\
Shattered Pixel Dungeon was inspired by the great classic Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games. It was developed in the spirit of the original Dungeon Master, where players had to think for themselves in order to overcome their obstacles. The game takes place in a randomly generated dungeon. There are many rooms and chambers which are filled with deadly monsters, traps, and treasures.\n\n\
  Players have to explore the Dungeon and defeat all its guardians and bosses if they ever want to see the light of day once more. If the hero dies, he or she must start from the beginning again. However, there is always the possibility to try out different characters and different races until the right combination is found.\n\
You think that you can escape our domain? Then let us see what you are capable of!
